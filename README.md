## 📦 Getting Started

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rakkshanda/claimrunner.ai.git
cd claimrunner.ai
npm install
Start the dev server
npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page reloads on save, and you’ll see lint errors in the console if any.

🧪 Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.

npm test
Launches the test runner in watch mode.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build/ folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes performance.

npm run eject
One-way operation! Gives full control of the build toolchain.

You don’t ever need to eject unless you're planning major custom configurations.
